# My Blog App

This is a full-stack blog application built using Central Station for real-time client-server communication.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To install the dependencies, run:
```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Application

To start the development server, run:
```bash
npm start
```


### Client-Side Usage

Open `blog/client/index.html` in your browser to view the application.

This setup provides a basic structure for a full-stack blog application under the /blog folder and route, without modifying the CentralStation class. You can expand on this by adding more features, such as user authentication, post creation, and more.
